# Event Management System
An EMS program for my Networks class where client-server communication is showcased in a real-time scenario. I've used Serialization and File Handling as a make-do alternative to a database since I only had about 9 hours to complete this. The program utilizes ArrayLists and has 2 (technically three entities but the Management one was scrapped and redundant after I implemented the GUI) entities as separate classes: 1) User 2) Event. The UI is very bare-bones and wonky cause I was learning Java Swing as I was coding it. I'll iron out some QoL issues (program stopping with error code when window is closed etc) and push as soon as I get the time.

## Setup
1) clone repo
2) run EventServer.java first
3) run ClientUI.java
4) Program will start
